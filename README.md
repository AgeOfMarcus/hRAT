# hRAT (hackerman Remote Access Tool)
hRAT is a remote access tool. It was developed and tested on linux but it could work on windows.

It relies mainly on the [hackerman](https://github.com/AgeOfMarcus/hackerman) library which I also wrote. It's pretty neat. It is a reverse-tcp type connection, which makes things a lot easier and more efficient.

It can handle quite a lot of clients, but I have no clue how many. lol.
